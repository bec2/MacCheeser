# MacCheeser
Cheese your MAC on Linux.<br>
Prerequisites: Relies on you having ifconfig installed. <br>
Can be easily customised to lengthen/shorten how long the spoof lasts, or for the name of your adapter if it's different.<br>
<br>
I trust you to be good with this. Don't do evil.
<br><br>
Function 1: View your current MAC address <br>
Function 2: Learn a little bit about what a MAC address is and why people may spoof them <br>
Function 3: Run a routine that replaces your MAC with a fake for one minute.
